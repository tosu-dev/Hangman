## More about ##
- This project was at the beginning, only a exercice that I made in OpenClassroom, but I thought it was interesting to upgrade it and make something pretty cool.
- The game is in french, so the 'menu' and words are in french but the code is written with english comment normaly.
- You can change words easily in the file _words.txt_
